THE world drank the equivalent of 4.7 litres of pure alcohol per person in 2010. That’s the result of skimming into a dataset published by World Health Organisation, Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH).

I also found that drinkings might have gone out of fashion with a steep decline in consumption compared with 5 years ago (Economist reported 6.1 litres of pure alcohol per person in 2005) (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/02/14/drinking-habits)


This makes sense. In almost every developed country, teenagers are starting with alcohol intake later than they used to. Part of the reason is the fact that they socialise a lot with each other online, rather than in person. Better parenting may contribute too. With given historical patterns, this later onset of drinking means today’s teenagers will be a generation of light drinkers when they grow up. Millennials, now in their 20s and 30s, are also drinking less alcohol. For them, moderation is part of a healthier lifestyle—the pursuit of which is starting to look like a mainstream trend, rather than a fad.

We now have a realistic hope for a world with much less alcohol.

Looking closer into countries around the world

The biggest boozers are mostly found in Europe while alcohol was least consumed in Africa. Interestingly, the Czechs & French are the most bibulous, getting through 11.8 litres each, nearly half of a litre more than the Germans in second place.

## Alcohol Consumption and Life Expectancy


In Africa, there is a negative correlation between Alcohol Consumption and Life Expectancy. The more litres of pure alcohol per person that country consumed, the lower its people’s life timespan.

## Drinkings Preferences Around the World


Inspired Hannahyan, I also employed hierarchical clustering methodology (hclust) and produced 5 clusters of drinking preferences. I came the same conclusion that countries that are geographically close has similar drinking habit, like we can see Russia, Belarus, Slovakia in one cluster, Switzerland and Luxembourg in one cluster, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria in one cluster.
